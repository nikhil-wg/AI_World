      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;">Amazon</b><br>
      Trade giant Amazon has invested in both the consumer-oriented side of AI and in applications for companies
      and their processes. Alexa, the company’s AI language assistant, integrated into its echo speaker series, is
      well-known worldwide. However, Amazon Web Services (AWS), a set of machine learning programs and pre-trained
      AI services for businesses, hasn’t yet done so much. AWS currently has more than 10,000 customers, including
      Siemens, Netflix, Tinder, NFL, and NASA. <br><br>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;">Apple </b><br>
      Apple has been busy acquiring AI start-ups in recent years and sees Artificial Intelligence as a critical
      part of its future. In December 2018, the company officially appointed John Giannandrea as head of the AI
      and Machine Learning department after Google poached the Scottish computer scientist. He will oversee the
      development of products such as Siri and the company’s new Create ML tool, which MacOS and iOS developers
      can use to create efficient and straightforward training courses for their apps. <br> <br>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> Banjo </b><br>
      Banjo was founded after the tragic bombings of the Boston Marathon 2013. The start-up uses AI to search
      social media to identify real-time events and situations that could be critical for emergency services and
      other organizations to operate faster and smarter. The company has raised more than $120 million in funding
      to date, including investors such as the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank.

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> DJI </b><br>
      The first Chinese company on the list, DJI, is still officially a start-up but has already been valued at 15
      billion dollars. The company has a market share of more than 70 percent in the global drone market and is
      increasingly entering the AI market. The latest drones use AI and image recognition to avoid objects. Soon,
      an entry into autonomous vehicles and robotics can be expected. DJI has recently entered into a partnership
      with Microsoft for a drone-to-computer streaming project. <br> <br> <br>

      <hr>
      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> Facebook </b><br>
      Artificial intelligence will be enormously powerful in the future. So it’s no surprise that Facebook is
      investing in AI. Facebook’s AI research group, known as FAIR, says it is committed to advancing the field of
      machine intelligence and developing new technologies to provide people with better ways to communicate. Mark
      Zuckerberg and Co. worked on a negotiation platform with two AIs called Alice and Bob, among other things,
      but ended the project after the couple began communicating in their secret language.

      <hr>
      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> Google</b><br>
      Perhaps the largest and most important AI company on this list is also the most obvious. Google has acquired
      AI start-ups as if there were going to be no more soon. Over the past four years, Mountain View has created
      no fewer than twelve new artificial intelligence companies. The most important purchase was the $400 million
      deal for DeepMind, the board game playing Go champion.
      There is also Google’s machine system TensorFlow, which is now free for all, and the ongoing Tensor AI chip
      project for machine learning on the device. Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has already mentioned that in the
      long run we are “evolving from a ‘mobile first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world in the computer industry,” and that
      already says everything you need to know to see where Google sees the future. <br><br>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> HiSilicon </b><br>
      When Huawei CEO Richard Yu unveiled the Kirin 980 at IFA 2018 in Berlin, the competition was very keen.
      HiSilicon, Huawei’s chip manufacturer, has significantly enhanced the second generation of the world’s first
      AI smartphone chip. The Kirin 980 can do things like face recognition, object recognition, image
      segmentation, and intelligent translation at high speed. The chip has sparked a flood of AI smartphone
      chips, and if a company is going to develop the technology further in the next few years, it probably will.
      <br><br>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> IBM </b><br>
      The multinational technology company IBM has been active in AI since the 1950s. The company was involved in
      the birth of artificial intelligence and is still firmly committed today. With Watson, IBM has created a
      machine learning platform that can integrate AI into business processes, such as building a chatbot for
      customer support. Customers include Big Four Auditor, KPMG and Bradesco, one of Brazil’s largest banks.

      <hr>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> Intel </b><br>

      Intel has also been on a shopping spree when it comes to artificial intelligence companies and has acquired
      both Nervana and Movidius as well as a selection of smaller AI start-ups. Nervana enables companies to
      develop specific deep learning software, while Movidius was founded to bring AI applications to devices with
      deficient performance. Intel is also working with Microsoft to provide AI acceleration for the Bing search
      engine. <br><br><br>
      <hr>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;">Microsoft </b><br>
      Like Amazon, Microsoft is involved in Artificial Intelligence on both the consumer and business sides.
      Cortana, Microsoft’s AI digital assistant, is in direct competition with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant.
      Artificial Intelligence features are a large part of the company’s Azure Cloud service, which provides
      chatbots and machine learning services to some of the biggest names in the business. Microsoft also
      purchased five AI companies in 2018 alone. <br><br>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;">Nvidia </b><br>
      Nvidia is one of the longest established AI companies and still plays an important role today. Nvidia’s
      graphics processors are the be-all and end-all for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The
      Delaware-based company is active in healthcare, higher education, retail, and robotics. With deep learning
      and GPU development, Nvidia is concerned with integrating AI into every level of the vehicle, manufacturing
      and autonomous driving. <br><br>
      <hr>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> OpenAI </b><br>
      The non-profit research group revolves around the development of AI for the benefit of all humankind and has
      managed to maintain its open source mentality, although large sums of money have been raised through
      investments and some through acquisitions. Some of the biggest names in AI currently work at OpenAI,
      including deep learning expert Ilya Sutskever. Sponsors include Microsoft, Amazon and Elon Musk. <br><br>

      <hr><br><br>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> Qualcomm </b><br>
      Like HiSilicon with its Kirin 980, Qualcomm is another chip manufacturer that is committed to artificial
      intelligence. AI plays a crucial role in the Snapdragon 855 mobile platform. The chip uses a signal
      processor for AI speech, audio and image functions. Qualcomm Snapdragons power some of the most popular
      smartphones on the market. If you’re interested in AI in the smartphone, you should keep an eye on Qualcomm.
      <br><br><br>
      <hr>

      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> SenseTimek </b><br>
      You heard about the Chinese government using face recognition to track citizens, right? Well, SenseTime is
      the current supplier of this technology. His research team is studying deep learning at the University of
      Hong Kong, and his image recognition technology is known to be way ahead of what Google and Facebook can do.
      Autonomous driving is currently SenseTime’s number one priority.
      <br><br><br>
      <hr>
      <br><b style=" text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;"> Twitter </b><br>
      Like the other big players in Silicon Valley, Twitter is all about getting into artificial intelligence,
      especially with money. Four AI companies have already been acquired, with Magic Pony being the most notable
      for $150 million. The Australian company is developing machine learning approaches for visual processing on
      the web and mobile devices, and Twitter is likely to improve its systems for recommending specific tweets in
      users’ timelines with AI in the future. <br><br><br>
