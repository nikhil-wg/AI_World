          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Intelligent
            robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity.
            Aristotle's development of the syllogism and it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in
            mankind's quest to understand its own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the
            history
            of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than a century. The following is a
            quick look at some of the most important events in AI. </p><br>

          <br><b>1943</b> <br>
          Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous
          Activity."
          The paper proposed the first mathematic model for building a neural network.
          <br> <br><b>1949</b><br>
          In his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the
          theory
          that neural pathways are created from experiences and that connections between neurons become
          stronger
          the more frequently they're used. Hebbian learning continues to be an important model in AI.
          <br><br><b>1950</b><br>
          Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence, proposing what is now known as the
          Turing
          Test, a method for determining if a machine is intelligent.
          Harvard undergraduates Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds build SNARC, the first neural network
          computer.
          Claude Shannon publishes the paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess."
          Isaac Asimov publishes the "Three Laws of Robotics."
          <br><br><b>1952</b><br>
          Arthur Samuel develops a self-learning program to play checkers.
          <br><br><b>1954</b><br>
          The Georgetown-IBM machine translation experiment automatically translates 60 carefully selected
          Russian
          sentences into English.
          <br><br><b>1956</b><br>
          The phrase artificial intelligence is coined at the "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial
          Intelligence." Led by John McCarthy, the conference, which defined the scope and goals of AI, is
          widely
          considered to be the birth of artificial intelligence as we know it today.
          Allen Newell and Herbert Simon demonstrate Logic Theorist (LT), the first reasoning program.
          <br><br><b>1958</b><br>
          John McCarthy develops the AI programming language Lisp and publishes the paper "Programs with
          Common
          Sense." The paper proposed the hypothetical Advice Taker, a complete AI system with the ability to
          learn
          from experience as effectively as humans do.
          <br><br><b>1959</b><br>
          Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and J.C. Shaw develop the General Problem Solver (GPS), a program
          designed
          to imitate human problem-solving.
          Herbert Gelernter develops the Geometry Theorem Prover program.
          Arthur Samuel coins the term machine learning while at IBM.
          John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky found the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project.
          <br><br><b>1963</b><br>
          John McCarthy starts the AI Lab at Stanford.
          <br><br><b>1966</b><br>
          The Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report by the U.S. government details
          the
          lack of progress in machine translations research, a major Cold War initiative with the promise of
          automatic and instantaneous translation of Russian. The ALPAC report leads to the cancellation of
          all
          government-funded MT projects.
          <br><br><b>1969</b><br>
          The first successful expert systems are developed in DENDRAL, a XX program, and MYCIN, designed to
          diagnose blood infections, are created at Stanford.
          <br><br><b>1972</b><br>
          The logic programming language PROLOG is created.
          <br><br><b>1973</b><br>
          The "Lighthill Report," detailing the disappointments in AI research, is released by the British
          government and leads to severe cuts in funding for artificial intelligence projects.
          <br><br><b>1974-1980</b><br>
          Frustration with the progress of AI development leads to major DARPA cutbacks in academic grants.
          Combined with the earlier ALPAC report and the previous year's "Lighthill Report," artificial
          intelligence funding dries up and research stalls. This period is known as the "First AI Winter."
          <br><br><b>1980</b><br>
          Digital Equipment Corporations develops R1 (also known as XCON), the first successful commercial
          expert
          system. Designed to configure orders for new computer systems, R1 kicks off an investment boom in
          expert
          systems that will last for much of the decade, effectively ending the first "AI Winter."
          <br><br><b>1982</b><br>
          Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry launches the ambitious Fifth Generation
          Computer
          Systems project. The goal of FGCS is to develop supercomputer-like performance and a platform for AI
          development.
          <br><br><b>1983</b><br>
          In response to Japan's FGCS, the U.S. government launches the Strategic Computing Initiative to
          provide
          DARPA funded research in advanced computing and artificial intelligence.
          <br><br><b>1985</b><br>
          Companies are spending more than a billion dollars a year on expert systems and an entire industry
          known
          as the Lisp machine market springs up to support them. Companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines
          Inc.
          build specialized computers to run on the AI programming language Lisp.
          <br><br><b>1987-1993</b><br>
          As computing technology improved, cheaper alternatives emerged and the Lisp machine market collapsed
          in
          <br><br><b> 1987</b><br>
          ushering in the "Second AI Winter." During this period, expert systems proved too expensive to
          maintain and update, eventually falling out of favor.
          Japan terminates the FGCS project in 1992, citing failure in meeting the ambitious goals outlined a
          decade earlier.
          DARPA ends the Strategic Computing Initiative in 1993 after spending nearly $1 billion and falling
          far
          short of expectations.
          <br><br><b>1991</b><br>
          U.S. forces deploy DART, an automated logistics planning and scheduling tool, during the Gulf War.
          <br><br><b>1997</b><br>
          IBM's Deep Blue beats world chess champion Gary Kasparov
          <br><br><b>2005</b><br>
          STANLEY, a self-driving car, wins the DARPA Grand Challenge.
          The U.S. military begins investing in autonomous robots like Boston Dynamic's "Big Dog" and iRobot's
          "PackBot."
          <br><br><b>2008</b><br>
          Google makes breakthroughs in speech recognition and introduces the feature in its iPhone app.
          <br><br><b>2011</b><br>
          IBM's Watson trounces the competition on Jeopardy!.
          <br><br><b>2012</b><br>
          Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain Deep Learning project, feeds a neural network using deep
          learning
          algorithms 10 million YouTube videos as a training set. The neural network learned to recognize a
          cat
          without being told what a cat is, ushering in breakthrough era for neural networks and deep learning
          funding.
          <br><br><b>2014</b><br>
          Google makes first self-driving car to pass a state driving test.
          <br><br><b>2016</b><br>
          Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats world champion Go player Lee Sedol. The complexity of the ancient
          Chinese game was seen as a major hurdle to clear in AI.
